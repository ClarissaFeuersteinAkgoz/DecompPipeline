\arguments{
\item{meth.data}{A \code{matrix} or \code{data.frame} containing methylation information. If NULL, methylation information needs to be provided
through \code{rnb.set}}

\item{rnb.set}{An object of type \code{\link{RnBSet-class}} containing methylation, sample and optional coverage information.}

\item{MARKER_SELECTION}{A vector of strings representing marker selection methods. Available method are \itemize{
         \item{"\code{all}"} Using all sites available in the input.
         \item{"\code{pheno}"} Selected are the top \code{N_MARKERS} site that differ between the phenotypic
                groups defined in data preparation or by \code{\link{rnb.sample.groups}}. Those are
                selected by employing limma on the methylation matrix.
         \item{"\code{houseman2012}"} The 50k sites reported as cell-type specific in the Houseman's reference-
                based deconvolution. See Houseman et.al. 2012.
         \item{"\code{houseman2014}"} Selects the sites said to be linked to cell type composition by \code{RefFreeEWAS},
                which is similar to surrogate variable analysis. See Houseman et.al. 2014.
         \item{"\code{jaffe2014}"} The sites stated as related to cell-type composition Jaffe et.al. 2014.
         \item{"\code{rowFstat}"} Markers are selected as those found to be associated to the reference cell
                types with F-statistics. If this option is selected, \code{REF_DATA_SET} and \code{REF_PHENO_COLUMN}
                need to be specified.
         \item{"\code{random}"} Sites are randomly selected.
         \item{"\code{pca}"} Sites are selected as those with most influence on the principal components.
         \item{"\code{var}"} Selects the most variable sites.
         \item{"\code{hybrid}"} Selects (N_MARKERS/2) most variable and (N_MARKERS/2) random sites.
         \item{"\code{range}"} Selects the sites with the largest difference between minimum and maximum
              across samples.
         \item{"\code{pcadapt}"} Uses principal component analysis as implemented in the \code{"bigstats"}
              R package to determine sites that are significantly linked to the potential cell types. This
              requires specifying K a priori (argument \code{K.prior}). We thank Florian Prive and Sophie
              Achard for providing the idea and parts of the codes.
         \item{"\code{edec_stage0}} Employs EDec's stage 0 to infer cell-type specific markers. By default
              EDec's example reference data is provided. If a specific data set is to be provided, it needs
              to be done through \code{REF_DATA_SET}.
         \item{"\code{custom}"} Specifying a custom file with indices.
}}

\item{N_MARKERS}{The number of sites to be selected. Defaults to 5000.}

\item{REMOVE_CORRELATED}{Flag indicating if highly correlated sites are to be removed}

\item{COR_THRESHOLD}{Numeric indicating a threshold above which sites are not to be considered in the feature selection.
If \code{"quantile"}, sites correlated higher than the 95th quantile are removed.}

\item{WRITE_FILES}{Flag indicating if the selected sites are to be stored on disk.}

\item{WD}{Path to the working directory used for analyis, or data preparation.}

\item{REF_DATA_SET}{An object of type \code{\link{RnBSet-class}} or a path to such an object stored on disk, 
if \code{rowFstat} is selected.}

\item{REF_PHENO_COLUMN}{Optional argument stating the column name of the phenotypic table of \code{REF_DATA_SET} with
the reference cell type.}

\item{N_PRIN_COMP}{Optional argument deteriming the number of prinicipal components used for selecting the most important sites.}

\item{RANGE_DIFF}{Optional argument specifying the difference between maximum and minimum required.}

\item{CUSTOM_MARKER_FILE}{Optional argument containing an absolute path to a file that specifies the indices used for employing MeDeCom. Can be provided
either as an \code{RDS} file containing a vector of indices to select or as a \code{txt, csv, tsv} file containing each index
to be selected as a single row.}

\item{store.heatmaps}{Flag indicating if a heatmap of the selected input sites is to be create from the input methylation matrix.
The files are then stored in the 'heatmaps' folder in WD.}

\item{heatmap.sample.col}{Column name in the phenotypic table of \code{rnb.set}, used for creating a color scheme in the heatmap.}

\item{K.prior}{K determined from visual inspection. Only has an influence, if \code{MARKER_SELECTION="pcadapt"}.}
}
\value{
List of indices, one entry for each marker selection method specified by \code{MARKER_SELECTION}. The indices correspond
         to the sites that should be used in \code{rnb.set}.
}
\description{
This routine selects a subset of CpGs sites used for MeDeCom analysis. Different selection methods are supported.
}
\details{
For methods "\code{houseman2012}" and "\code{jaffe2014}", a predefined set of markers is used. Since those correspond to
         absolute indices on the chip, the provided \code{rnb.set} must not be preprocessed and therefore still contain all sites.
         For the other metods, you may used \code{\link{prepare_data}} to filter sites for quality and context.
